# Splendor-AI

Welcome to the Splendor-AI repository! This project allows you to play online versus a superhuman AI in the long-term planning board game Splendor, which won Board Game of the Year in 2014.  

I'm sparing any details here as they are all hosted at https://github.com/BreckEmert/Splendor-AI, which hosts the desktop version of the game (slightly behind in features compared to this webapp version), any reinforcement learning training, and details.
